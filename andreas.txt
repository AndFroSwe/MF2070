Validity conserns in quantitative research

In (1), several types of validity are defined. One of these is content
validity. This type of validity regards whether or not the items in the survey
properly covers all the relevant data of the sample domain. Content validity is
subjective (1) and is usually determined by a group of experts (1)(2).
When conducting quantitative research, one should consider external validity,
which regards whether or not the results are generalizable. One external
perspective according to (3) is ecological validity where one considers whether
the research study was realistic and as such if the results are applicable in a
natural enviroment.
